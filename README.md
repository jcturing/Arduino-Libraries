# Arduino-Libraries
Here I store the libraries I use, create or modify.
Some of them are personally created and others are just little modifications from the original ones.

_All credits of the other libraries goes to their respective owners._

* **QTRSensors**: Modification of the original library [QTRSensors](https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J19). It is suited the library to work with a CD74HC4067 Multiplexor and improves the readLine method to be more accurate.
* **DRV8835MotorShield**: Original library for the DRV8835 Dual Motor Driver. The original one can be found here [DRV8835MotorShield](https://github.com/pololu/drv8835-motor-shield).
